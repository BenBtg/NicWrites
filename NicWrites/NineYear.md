# Nine Year-Old's are NOT SEXY

Today I realised there is no such thing as a sexy nine year-old. Now, I know that’s quite an odd declaration, and obviously one would hope that I was aware of this prior to my realisation, and naturally I was, but I’d never really thought it out loud before.

Around the age of nine, non-coincidentally, our dad had taken us on holiday, some little island in the Med. Menorca I think. Anyway, as you’d expect, for a kid that had never been abroad before, I found the whole experience mesmeric. I shan’t bore you with the details of the beauty of the landscape to set the scene; it’s the Mediterranean, it’s lovely because it’s not fucking raining for eight months of the year.

The place we were staying did the usual cheesy kid’s entertainment in the early evening. Now, I don’t wish to brag, but on the dance floor, my sister and I were some top notch shit. We’d had numerous summers of Red Coat led dance offs, talent contests and games of oh-so-competitive musical statues. This holiday, without a doubt, was, is, and will remain, the high point of my dance floor career. Nowadays, my moves resemble the struggle to put together an IKEA wardrobe. I’m embarrassed, and if you’re not embarrassed by me, then we’ve not yet had the pleasure of a night out.

By the end of the first night, we’d nailed down every dance routine the entertainment staff could throw at us. I feel like I should mention at this point that we’d been on a gin factory tour earlier that day, and our dad had a VERY laid back attitude about his nine and ten year olds consuming many, many tiny bottles of varying colours and flavours of gin throughout the night. Amazingly, neither of us got sick, and we both have crystal clarity of the events of the nights that followed.

I guess we were the epitome of pureness and beauty, set by the standards of the media at the time. So close in age were we that we were often mistook as twins. Big blue eyes, long, thick blonde hair, waif-like in our posture and bone structure. You’re not aware of these things yourself, not at nine or ten.

I don’t remember exactly which night it happened, that could possibly be attributed to the booze I suppose, but I do remember having the desperate need to piss during a Spice Girls number, but my will was stronger than my bladder, and I saw it through to the end.
The toilets were not far from the dance floor, but passed by the bar on the way. Our dad hadn’t managed to get a table that evening, but seemed more than content propped against the bar, making new friends with the waiting staff. We waved and smiled at him between our mad dashing around, I guess he must have been in the toilet himself on this particular occasion, when a man grabbed my arm, stopping me.

Not only is no nine year-old sexy, but most nine year-olds are trusting as hell. I mean, try to look back, remember being nine. If an adult had stopped you in any situation, you probably had that fairly unjust respect and would stare up at them wide eyed, supposing everything they said was of the upmost importance.

“I’ve been watching you dance. You’re really, really good. And pretty. And sexy.” – That’s exactly what he said. I remember it so clearly because it confused the crap out of me. I couldn’t understand why he wasn’t watching his own children dance, I was embarrassed by the thought of another parent watching me, it hadn’t occurred to me that anyone would take any notice of us but our dad. I was uncomfortable, I’d pissed myself, and I didn’t know why he was still holding me.

I snapped out of it when his mates started to laugh at his comment to me. Yanked my arm free. I thanked him. I fucking thanked him for the compliment. So ingrained are my good manners that I couldn’t just try for a dignified, silent exit.
I had to go get changed, so I found my dad and asked for the keys to our rooms. He either didn’t notice or was so used to the bed wetting I’d done as a younger child that it didn’t faze him.
But he did ask if I was ok. I told him, very matter-of-factly, thinking he just wanted an explanation for the dirtied leopard print flares – I did mention the Spice Girls were hot shit then right?

The guy ended up being dragged outside by the collar of his shirt and kicked the shit out of by my dad. Staff ran outside to stop him, I guess, but after some shouting they joined in too.
We didn’t see that man again, nor do I remember my dad paying for another drink. I didn’t join my sister on the dance floor for the rest of our stay. I stayed by my dad’s side for the rest of the holiday.


Nine year-olds are not sexy.
